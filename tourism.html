            <h1>Tourism in Goa</h1>
            <p id="intro">
                Tourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with lower tourist activity 
                inland. In 2010, there were more than 2 million tourists reported to have visited Goa, 
                about 1.2  million of whom were from abroad. As of 2013, Goa was a destination of 
                choice for Indian and foreign tourists, particularly Britons and Russians, with 
                limited means who wanted to vacation outside of their countries. The state was hopeful 
                that changes could be made which would attract a more upscale demographic. <br/>
                Goa stands 6th in the Top 10 Nightlife cities in the world in National Geographic 
                Travel. Notable nightclubs in Goa include Chronicle, Mambos and Sinq. 
                One of the biggest tourist attractions in Goa is water sports. Beaches like Baga and 
                Calangute offer jet-skiing, parasailing, banana boat rides, water scooter rides, and 
                more. Patnem beach in Palolem stood third in CNN Travel's Top 20 Beaches in Asia. <br/>

                Over 450 years of Portuguese rule and the influence of the Portuguese culture presents 
                to visitors to Goa a cultural environment that is not found elsewhere in India. Goa is 
                often described as a fusion between Eastern and Western culture with Portuguese culture 
                having a dominant position in the state be it in its architectural, cultural or social 
                settings. The state of Goa is famous for its excellent beaches, churches, and temples. 
                The Bom Jesus Cathedral, Fort Aguada and a new wax museum on Indian history, culture 
                and heritage in Old Goa are other tourism destinations.

                    The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches. Tourism is its primary 
                    industry, and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased 
                    tourist activity inland. Goa's beaches cover about 125 kilometres (78 mi) of its 
                    coastline. These beaches are divided into North and South Goa.<br/>

            <p id="info">
                <img src="oldGoa.jpeg" height="350px" width="460px" float alt="Basilica of Bom Jesus">
                Goa has one World Heritage Site: the Bom Jesus Basilica with churches and convents 
                of Old Goa. The basilica holds the mortal remains of Francis Xavier, regarded by 
                many Catholics as the patron saint of Goa (the patron of the Archdiocese of Goa is 
                actually Saint Joseph Vaz). These are both Portuguese-era monuments and reflect a 
                strong European character. The relics are taken down for veneration and for public 
                viewing, per the prerogative of the Church in Goa, not every ten or twelve years as 
                popularly thought and propagated. The last exposition was held in 2014.<br/>
                Goa has the Sanctuary of Saint Joseph Vaz in Sancoale. Pilar monastery which holds 
                novenas of Venerable Padre Agnelo Gustavo de Souza from 10 to 20 November yearly. 
                There is a claimed Marian apparition at the Church of Saints Simon and Jude at Batim, 
                Ganxim, near Pilar, where Goans and non-resident Goans visit. There is the statue 
                of the bleeding Jesus on the Crucifix at the Santa Monica Convent in Velha Goa. There 
                are churches (Igorzo), like the baroque styled Nixkollounk Gorb-Sombhov Saibinnich 
                Igorz (Church of the Our Lady of Immaculate Conception) in Panaji, the Gothic styled 
                Mater Dei (Dev Matechi Igorz/ Mother of God) church in Saligao and each church having 
                its own style and heritage, besides Kopelam/ Irmidi (chapels).<br/>
                The Velhas Conquistas regions are known for Goa-Portuguese style architecture. There 
                are many forts in Goa such as Tiracol, Chapora, Corjuem, Aguada, Reis Magos, Nanus, 
                Mormugao, Fort Gaspar Dias and Cabo de Rama.<br/>
                In many parts of Goa, mansions constructed in the Indo-Portuguese style architecture 
                still stand, though, in some villages, most of them are in a dilapidated condition. 
                Fontainhas in Panaji has been declared a cultural quarter, showcasing the life, 
                architecture and culture of Goa. Influences from the Portuguese era are visible in 
                some of Goa's temples, notably the Shanta Durga Temple, the Mangueshi Temple, the 
                Shri Damodar Temple and the Mahalasa Temple. After 1961, many of these were demolished 
                and reconstructed in the indigenous Indian style.<br/>

                In Goa there are nine large rivers, all of them flow out Western Ghat and flow into 
                the Arabian Sea. 42 smaller tributaries join them, forming a large system of inland 
                waters of Goa called here "backwaters".<br/>
                The biggest rivers are Sal, Tiracol, Chapora, Baga, Mandovi, Zuari, Saleri, Talpona, 
                Galgibaga. Among them only basins of the rivers Mandovi and Zuari occupy the area of 
                2553 square kilometers that makes about 70% of the general geographical zone of Goa. 
                The navigable rivers of Goa with a general length of 253 km are the main blood vessels 
                of the state and the integral part of its life.<br/>
                To "backwaters" system of Goa belong also some large and great numbers of small lakes. 
                The best known are Mayem, Carmbolim, Cutorim.<br/>
                For tourists "backwaters" of Goa offer an unforgettable adventure in the form of cruise 
                by the boat. So-called houseboats are widespread in this part of India. These are the 
                real floating houses; there are bedrooms with a bathroom, living room and all necessary 
                rooms, including office for crew. These vessels have very original structure. They are 
                produced from a tree of anjili and only natural materials as a bamboo and palm leaves. 
                The houseboat is constructed without nails and other metal holding elements.<br/>
                Many local and foreign travel agencies offer cruises on houseboats on water channels 
                of Goa which can last from several hours to one day. For tourists there are various 
                arrangements onboard.<br/>
                Such excursions are ideal opportunity to communicate with real local residents from 
                near villages or with tribes occupying the deep jungle, and to spend some time in an 
                unusual situation among the tropical nature. In the rivers of Goa lives incalculable 
                quantity of bird species. Some manage to observe the crocodiles. The opportunities for 
                fishing are improbable, and then the personnel may cook your catch at your desire and 
                taste. Also there are romantic dinners and nights in the floating house.<br/>

            <p id="info">
                Forest cover in Goa is diverse. Goa is India's smallest state terms of area and the 
                fourth smallest in terms of population. Goa is located on the west coast of India 
                in the region known as the Konkan Forest cover in Goa stands at 1,424 km sq, most of 
                which is owned by the government. Government owned forest is estimated at 1224.38 km sq 
                whilst private is given as 200 km sq. Most of the forests in the state are located in 
                the interior eastern regions of the state. The Western Ghats, which form most of eastern 
                Goa, have been internationally recognised as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the 
                world. In the February 1999 issue of National Geographic Magazine, Goa was compared 
                with the Amazon and Congo basins for its rich tropical biodiversity.<br/>
                Nanda Lake is the first and the only Ramsar wetland site in Goa. Goa's state animal 
                is the Gaur, the state bird is the Ruby-throated yellow Bulbul, which is a variation 
                of Black-crested Bulbul, and the state tree is the Matti.<br/>
                The important forests products are bamboo canes, Maratha barks, chillar barks and 
                the bhirand. Coconut trees are ubiquitous and are present in almost all areas of 
                Goa barring the elevated regions. Much deciduous vegetation, including teak, sal, 
                cashew and mango trees, is present. Fruits include jackfruits, mangos, pineapples 
                and blackberries.<br/>
                Foxes, wild boars and migratory birds are found in the jungles of Goa. The avifauna 
                includes kingfishers, mynas and parrots. Numerous types of fish are also caught off 
                the coast of Goa and in its rivers. Crabs, lobsters, shrimps, jellyfish, oysters and 
                catfish form some of the piscine catch. Goa also has a high snake population, which 
                keeps the rodent population in control. Goa has many famous National Parks, including 
                the renowned Salim Ali bird sanctuary.<br/>
                Goa has more than 33% of its geographic area under government forests (1224.38 km sq) 
                of which about 62% has been brought under Protected Areas (PA) of Wildlife Sanctuaries 
                and National Park. Since there is a substantial area under private forests and a large 
                tract under cashew, mango, coconut, etc. plantations, the total forest and tree cover 
                constitutes 56.6% of the geographic area.<br/>
